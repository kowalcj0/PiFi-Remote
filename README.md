# PiFi Add-on #

Version: 1.1.0

PiFi is a set of python scripts running as daemons to improve the experience of mpd on Raspberry Pi.
It has been tested with Volumio 1.4 and it adds:

* Support for IR remote control.
  You can use a small IR remote control (e.g. apple) along with a Flirc USB module acting as a keyboard with the raspberry pi.

* Support for LCD display (16x2 from Adafruit).
  It displays track and volume information on the screen.
